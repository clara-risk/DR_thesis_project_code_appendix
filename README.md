# Master's Thesis Project Data Preparation Appendix - Doriana Romualdi 

The following repository contains the Python code that was used to prepare the data for a Master's thesis project as well as the data in final form.  

1: DR_canlabs_extract_preNBR_postNBR_RBR.py 

This script was used to extract the preNBR, postNBR, and calculate RBR from the preNBR and dNBR values from Canlabs, found here: https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/Forest-fires_Incendie-de-foret/CanLaBS-Burned_Severity-Severite_des_feux/ 

The final product of this script is a csv file containing the maximum, median, mean, and 90th percentile values inside each selected fire perimeter from the Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB) in British Columbia.
